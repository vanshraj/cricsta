				p
					strong You play while the stars do!
				p
					| Prosportleague is the only fantasy game that you play while you watch a match. This is a competitive game that challenges your predictive skills in your favourite game; with a bank balance of 500 tokens for every match.
				p
					| An intuitive game for all, being a cricket fan is a plus! Follow these simple steps to play along with the stars!
				p  
					strong 1 Game objective
				p
					| The objective of the game is to 
					strong maximise the number of tokens
					|  you have at the end of the match.
				p
					strong 2 Understand the points system
				p
					| The points system is a critical element of the game. At the end of the match, for every player will be marked 
					strong at the actual points 
					| scored by the particular player in the match.
				p
					| Click on the icons below to have a look at the points system.

				.ui.button.orange.mini.inverted.odipoint ODI points system
				.ui.button.orange.mini.inverted.t20point T20 points system
				p
				p
					| As can be seen, we use only four variables. The runs scored by the batsmen, wickets taken by the bowler, batsman's strike rate (after minimum balls are faced by him) and bowler's economy rate (after minimum overs are bowled by him).
				p
					strong 3 Estimate and invest
				p
					| At any point in the game our Cricsta model will give the number of points it thinks the player will score by the end of the match.
				ul
					li
						| You buy a player if you think he will score more points than the Cricsta model estimates.
					li 
						| Each point of a player is worth 1 token. You start the game with 500 tokens for a 50 over match, 300 for a 20 over match.
					li
						| The Cricsta model will update after every ball. So the price you buy your player will differ ball to ball.
					li
						| You can buy a player for two shares instead of 1. For example, if you buy a player worth 35 points, you will use 35 of your 500 tokens to buy him once, 70 tokens to buy him twice and so on.
					li
						| You can also sell a player you have bought. You will do this when you now think the Cricsta model is giving points as per your estimates or you see a greater opportunity elsewhere.
					li 
						| You can buy and sell players multiple times during a match.
					li
						| The maximum invested at any time is 500 tokens. However, if 10 tokens of profit have already been booked, then those 10 tokens can be re-invested on another player. Conversely, if 10 tokens of loss booked, then the total investment value becomes 490 tokens.
				p
					strong 4 Transfer Window 
				p
					| You can buy and sell a player only when the transfer window is open. This is signified by the green button on top of the screen. 
				p
					| The transfer window is open during the following times – 
				ul
					li
						| After the playing XIs are announced in the toss, till the 1st ball is bowled
					li 
						| After the last ball of an over, for a time period of 60 seconds. A countdown timer will appear on the screen to show the time you have left to transfer.
					li
						| In the innings break till the 1st ball of the 2nd innings is bowled.

				p
					strong How do I play on Prosportsleague?
				p
					| 1 Register / login on 
					a(href='http://www.prosportsleague.com') www.prosportsleague.com?
				p
					| 2 Add money to account for a money game. Or use free credits given for virtual game
				p
					| 3 Choose your game. For every match there are several choices, based on the buy-in you are comfortable with, or if the game is virtual or real, plus if you want to choose a dynamic intra-match game or a static pre-match one.
				p
					strong When does the game start?
				p
					| This game starts around 15 minutes before the first ball is scheduled to be bowled. You can start buying and selling players at any time up to the last ball of the match when the transfer window is open.
				p
					strong Who wins the game?
				p
					| The contestant with the highest number of tokens at the end of the match. All player holdings at the end of the match will be closed at the actual points scored by each player.
				p
					strong How do I take positions?
				p
					| Buy a player who you think will score more than the Cricsta model. If you feel strongly about any player, you can buy two shares.
				p
					| However, you can buy only up to the total tokens available. In the start of the game, each player has 500 / 300 tokens for a ODI / t20. 
				p
					strong Does the price of each player change during the match?
				p
					| Yes! Our Cricsta model will update its estimates of every player's points at every ball. Therefore, the price each player is available at will change accordingly. At the end of the match, all players will be marked on the actual points they score.
				p
					strong When is the transfer window open?
				ul
					li
						| After the playing XIs are announced in the toss, till the 1
						sup st
						|  ball is bowled
					li
						| After the last ball of an over, for a time period of 60 seconds. A countdown timer will appear on the screen to show the time you have left to transfer.
					li
						| In the innings break till the 1
						sup st
						|  ball of the 2
						sup nd
						|  innings is bowled.
				p
					strong Will my holdings be live for subsequent matches?
				p
					| No! Every new match is a fresh game. Your holdings are netted off at the end of the match against the actual points scored by the player.
				p
					strong What if a player in my holding does not play?
				p
					| This is not possible as we start the game after the toss only. So the 22 players on your game screen are playing the match.
				p
					strong Is there a limit on the number for players in my holdings?
				p
					| No! The number of players are only limited by the number of tokens available to you. Choose wisely between diversifying among a number of players are concentrating your bets on a particular player.
				p
					strong Can I only pick players from one of the sides?
				p Yes! There is no limit on holdings per side
				p
					strong
						| I feel 5 players will score more points than the Cricsta model. However, I have exhausted my budget in the first 4 players. What do I do?
				p That is the challenge. You have to maintain your budget.
				p
					strong How long does it take for a player I have bought to reflect in my holdings?
				p It will be instantaneous.
				p
					strong Can I change my holdings during the match?
				p
					| Yes! You can buy and sell players while the match is on, as long as the transfer window is open.
				p
					strong How can I see my rank?
				p
					| Just click on the leader board to see how well you are doing against your fellow contestants. This is updated at the end of every ball
				p
					strong Why are some players have a low estimated points from the Cricsta model?
				p The Cricsta model looks at player ability and math situation.
				p
					| An example: A weak team A bats first against a strong team B. Our Cricsta model will price the middle and late order batsmen of team B at low points as compared to other players in the match. This is because, in many cases, the top order batsman of team B will score most of the runs required to be chased, leaving little points to be scored by the rest.
